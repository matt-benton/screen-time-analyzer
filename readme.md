Screen Time Analyzer is a web application for tracking screen habits and the effects thereof. It can be useful if you want to record how much time you are spending in front of a screen, what you're doing, which monitor/screen you are using, and even what chair you are sitting in. It also lets you record how you eyes feel and if you are experiencing any symptoms such as dryness or soreness.
